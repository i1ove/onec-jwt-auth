## 📖 Overview
Welcome to the onec-jwt-auth project! This application provides a straightforward solution for authenticating HTTP API requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in 1C. It allows for issuing JWT tokens using both Personal Access Tokens (PAT) and Basic authentication, while also verifying incoming JWT tokens with the RS256 algorithm. Access rights are managed through scopes and roles on top of the 1C platform.

The application includes a double token control mechanism, ensuring security by validating both the platform's validator and checking the session in a register. Secrets are cleaned up in logs, and errors are mapped to HTTP statuses like 401, 403, and 500. The project also offers an example API to help you extend its capabilities.
